\section*{Project Summary}
The project was to write a program in x86 assembly language that uses the
first command-line parameter as a number N from 0 through 100. The
program should print out F(N), in hexadecimal.



\section*{Challenges}

\noindent
Trying to get the decimal output option to work was not fun. Neither was
supporting up to the 300th Fibonacci number. Those numbers are huge.



\section*{Successes}

\noindent
A group member already previously wrote a bash script for testing. I was able
to clean it up and modify it for this project.

\noindent
Having been out of class for two days, there was a lot of catching up to
do. I was able to lean on my group members to help me get back up to speed.



\section*{Lessons Learned}

\noindent
I now have a testing script that I can use for future projects.
